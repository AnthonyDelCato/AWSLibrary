    - what is volume
    - block based storage
    - instances storage; ephemeral(temporary)
      - connected directly to the hypervisor with cable
      - conencted to only one instance
      - loose data when it stop
      - low latency
      - no replication
      - snapshot are not avaliable
      - both ssd and hdd based
      - closest storage device to your instance 
    - elastic block storage; work with cells; NAS or SAN
      - connect woth wifi
      - faster than instance storage

    - 4 kb each block in block based EBS
    - only related EC2 can call the data
    -  there are 6 type of volumes in 2 categories
    -  HDD backed is better throughput performance mesure than IOPS(input output per seccond)
    -  througput vs iops; iops faster but throupput carry much more
    -  SSD better read write performance(solid read write drives)
    -  general purpose SSD, provisional purpose IOPS SSD it mmay differ 
    -  throupput for bigdata and datawarehuse
    -  for low cost thruogh put chose
    -  high lrevel transaction needs for iops ssd
    -  nitro instance; it may connect a lotof volumes
    -  ataching, detaching, mounting, partition, resizing(single partition)
