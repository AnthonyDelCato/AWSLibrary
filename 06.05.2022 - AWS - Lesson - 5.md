Topics
  - Cloud Formation
    - AWS CF stand for reach a ec2 without console on amazon
    - there is templates which are using for run ec2 remotely
    - templates are produced for future useges of ec2
    - templates are producing with YAML and JSON
    - YAML is using for conf documents in generaly
    - JSON is using  generally in AWS also
    - YAML and JSON are just formats
    - we will use VS CODE
    - in VSC yaml to json is good experience
    - and also there is some validation for Yaml and json
    - so these extentions for vscode are important to use
     
  - What is YAML
    - it is a format to stora some data
    - it is a data serialisation languge
    - commonly used for configuration files and in application where data is being stored or transmited
    - key value are main components
    - human readable
    - portable
    - it works with multiple prog lang
    - consistent 
    - support generic tools
    - easy to use adapt and implement
    - case sensitive
    - # is comment for yaml
    - - is using for list members
    - --- is using for seperate doc
    - ... end of doc
    - null or ~ is for null
    - ! ? & special char for yaml
    - & for repeated objects
    - * for reference an object
    - ? for complex mapping
    - block stly or flow style
    - | for diff lines 
    - string in single qoute or double qoute
    - > is for one line sentence
    - slim and flexible
    - better for conf
    - object
      - key: value
        - key always string * 
        - value is scalar so it can be everthong
      - array
        - null value
        - booleon
        - integer
      - paragraph
        - blank lines denote

        - paragraph breaks
      - content
        - or we
        - can auto
        - convert line breaks
        - to save space
    - Yaml is not a markup lang
    - it is a standart format for sharing files mainly using conf files but it is also transmit data diff aplications
    - .yaml and .yml extentions
  
  - what is JSON
    - data serialasation languaga
    - mainly using for API s
    - AWS AMI policies are producing wth also json 
    - not moslty human readable
    - for structuring data
    - primarly for tranmisiton and sometimes store databy serves and applicatuions
    - leightweight format for soring ang transprting
    - from server to web page or app
    - self describing easy to understand
    - key and values
    - {} for objects
    - square bracet for arrays
    - data sep by commas
    - name value pairs
    - ordered list of values
    - {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"MC"}
    - : is using for seperating
    - string are writing with double qoute "string"
    - objects are startt with curly bracet {
    - arrays ara start with XXX
    - javascript object notation
    - minimal
    - \\ for string using for double qoute instring
    - rreadable format for structuring data
    - trasmit data between web app and also store date
    - .json
 
  - Comparason YAML and JSON
    - yaml for config files
    - json for apis
    - yaml comments are posible
    - support diff datatypes
    - self ref
    - embeded block literals
    - hierarchy for yaml indentation
    - json hierarchy for bracekts
    
    
  - openexchangerates.org  
    - there is prepared json files for api s
    - 
  - extentions
    - yaml for validation
    - yaml to json is for translating
    - convert to yaml or convert to json selections
    - it could be slected part or all the file
    -

- CLOUD FORMATION
  - easy
  - create delete modify one or few aws resources
  - houndreds
  - infrastructure as Code (IaC/IaaC)
  - create manage configure replicate delte aws resources easily and rapidly using templates
  - stack means all components of cloud computing ec2s and s3s snss
  - templates(yaml or json) > cloud formation(framewrok) > stack(confed aws resources)
  
- TEMPLATES
  - json or yaml formatted
  - to create aws resources
  - structure
    - template version
    - description
    - metadata
    - paramaters
    - mappings
    - conditions
    - transform
    - resoures
    - outputs
    -  
  - cloud formation work like;
    - crate or use existing template 
    - save locally or in s3 bucket
    - use aws cloud formation to create a stack based on your tmeplate it constuct and configure rsources
    
    
- CREATING A STACK WIRH TEMPLATE
  - clouf formation template anathomy search and find the ready format on aws
  - find in that ec2 instance
  - cloud formation snippet helps us for temlapte
  - cloudformation ointer will check it
  - write on vscode 'cfn' for use cloudformation snippets chose it
  - in the resources section write ec2 ins and slect opening choices
  - logicalid may change with its using field
  - delete unnecessry parts of template they will be default selected
  - when seect a line on template it will show docs to how write it via extention
  - image id comes from console default amazon ami ami-0022f774911c1d690
  - instance type t2..micro
  - keyname our own key without pem
  - sec group defined sec group names come from console
  - tags Key: Name and Value: CFN-instances

- PAY ATTENTION FOR IN YAML DONT USE TAB FOR INDENTATION I MAY CAUSE PROBLEM

```AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
Description: |
  This template launches an ec2 instance which enables SSH.
  
Resources:
  CFNInstance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      ImageId: ami-0022f774911c1d690
      InstanceType: t2.micro
      KeyName: guile  # Please use your key pair name without .pem
      SecurityGroups:
        - cfn-sec-group
      Tags:
        - Key: Name
          Value: CFN-Instance
 ```

- LAST PART
  - create a stack on cloudformation
  - chose our template and keep next
  - woda instance created
  - if there is problem cf rollback it and delete all the created resorces and you dont need to delete oll of them


- Time to Deletion
  - choose stack and click delete to terminate all resources
  -   


THIS IS ALL INFRASTUCRURE AS CODE
