      - pricing model;
        - on demand instance;
          - pay for hour or the second
          - no commitment
          - no upfront payment
          - increase or decrease capacity
          - pre estimated
          - short term
          unpredicteable workloads
          - cannot be interrupted
          - pricing; 0.0116/hour / 0.00019 cent$ second payment N.V.
          - one moth 8.32$
          
        - reserved instance;
          - cheaper than con demand 75% on demeand discount 1-3 year commitment
          - steady state usage
          - app may require reserved capacity
          - commit to use 1 to 3 years
          - may reserve hours 
          - ex. 5 instance for 7/24 and extara 5 instance for just mornings 8 to 8

        - dedicated instance
          - dedicated to your use
