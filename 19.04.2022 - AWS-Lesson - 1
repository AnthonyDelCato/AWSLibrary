Topics - What is AWS, Wys Cloud Computing?, 
  - Nowadays every internet action relies on the cloud directly.
  - It is for reducing the costs
  - high level of security
  - provide flexiblity
  - less cost for maintenence
  - benefits; 
     - cost eficiency, not need investmenet for hardware, scalable with the needs
     - elasticity and flexiblity, give chance to increase or decrese using resource, it wors everywhere
      - reliability, secure data, always have back up ready
      - increased security, no need security cost, everything on cloud is secure against broken or stolen,
      - manageability, u need just internet and laptop to reach everything
      - availablity, extending if needed bandwith, execution and operation continue flow
      - centralization, all data in one location, reachable everywhere
      - auto-update, cloude service provider do verything
      - no maintenence, 
   - disadvantages;
      - internete dependancy, low speed is diffucult to reach
      - downtime, if loud provider down, no reach
      - loss control, if u use cloud, u know that sensitive data is also shairing
      - lack of support, no needed support at all the time
 
 Topics - Cloud Computing Architecture
  - Front-end and Back-end
  - Fe - client part, user, user interface, ie. webbrowsers
  - Be - host manage, virtual machine, data storage, deployment models, traffic control, et. built in security systems.
  - Actor / Role Based Model; cloud consumer, cloud provider, cloud broker, cloud auditor, cloud carries.
  
 Topics - Cloud DEployment Models
  - Public Cloud, Private Cloud, Community Cloud, Hybrid Cloud
  - Broad network access, self service, measured service, shared resource, elastic.
  - Amazon EC2, Google AppEngine, Windows Azure, IBM Blue Cloud are public clouds
  - private cloud is more secure, prevent data loss, reduce cost some condition.
  - community cloud, lower cost, easy to share and colloborate

  - Software as a servise, on-demand service, pay per use, independent platform, no need to install, avaliable for multiple user, cheap, vendor manage, reach by browser, acceessible form any platform, reach from everywhere, good for colloboration, vendor provide modest tools, allow for multi user, pratable, internet performance important, some restriction, especially END Customers
  - Platform as a services, Develeopers use it
  - Infrastructure as a service, Sys admins use it, like amazon ec2, icloud apple. azure, ggole cloud, 
  
 Topics - Cloud Service Models
  - On-premise; everthing depends you
  - Infrastructure as a service, scalable
  - Platform as a service, AWS Elacstic Beanstalk, FGoogle app enginde, microsoft azure, cost time eeffectif and sit for one application devellopper
  - Software as a service, connect and use model over internet, e mail, office, reliable
