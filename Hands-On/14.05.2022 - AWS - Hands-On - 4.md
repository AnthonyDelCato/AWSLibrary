# PART 1 - EXTEND ROOT VOLUME

# Launch an Amazon Linux 2 instance with default ebs volume and ssh to it.
# List block devices (lsblk) and file system disk space usage (df) of the instance. 
# Only root volume should be listed with the default capacity.
lsblk
df -h
# Check file system of the root volume's partition.
sudo file -s /dev/xvda1
# Go to Volumes, select instance's root volume and modify it (increase capacity 8 GB >> 12 GB).
# List block devices (lsblk) and file system disk space usage (df) of the instance again.
# Root volume should be listed as increased but partition and file system should be listed same as before.
lsblk
df -h
# Extend partition 1 on the modified volume and occupy all newly avaiable space.
sudo growpart /dev/xvda 1
# Resize the xfs file system on the extended partition to cover all available space.

# List block devices (lsblk) and file system disk space usage (df) of the instance again.
# Partition and file system should be extended.

# PART 2 - CREATE NEW EBS VOLUME, ATTACH IT AND MODIFY

# Create a new volume "in the SAME AZ with the INSTANCE" (2 GB for this demo).
# Attach the new volume to the instance and then list block storages again.
# Root volume and the newly created second volumes should be listed.

# PART 3 - CREATE NEW EBS VOLUME (AND PARTITION), ATTACH IT AND MODIFY

# List volumes to show current status, Root and second volumes should be listed.
