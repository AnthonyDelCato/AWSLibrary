Topics - What is AWS, Why Cloud Computing?, 
  - Nowadays every internet action relies on the cloud directly.
  - It is for reducing the costs, pay what you consume
  - high level of security
  - provide flexiblity
  - it is zeitgeist
  - less cost for maintenence
  - centralization, cost effiecency, reliability, elesticity, flexibility, manageability, auto updating, increased security, less mainteneance, availability.
  - increased value of the work(cloud native, cloud agnostic) works everywhere
  - cloud is the new black
  - scalability need
  - virtualization; server and client; backend, frontend, database 3 server needed for an application;one hardware one virtual machine monitor may serves for 3 diff os and app this is virtual architrcture, scale out, scale down if needed and if not needed,type of vir; server virtualization, software virtualization, storage virtualization, o/s virtualization.
  - containerazation technology; docker is a container store some prepared file. one hardware, one operation system and a docker engine serve 3 app container. so there is needed just one os, one hardware serve 3 app container at the same time. without any confusion. disad is a all in one problem. but it is cheap.os is generally linux. some says dockerazation.docker use ec2,so aws.
   - software development cycle; req analysis, design, implement, test, evoluate is a circle always renew with update requirement. cloud tech change this cycle, now it is more short.code, plan, monitor, sperate, deploy, release, test, build, code again. this is devops life cycle. always renewal.
  - sdlc; software develeopment architecture; monolithic infrastructure changed, now there is microservices, and these microservices using with docker, so microservers work with docker docker with ec2 ec2 with aws. disadv is the handle it together in coordination. API gateway, API management is Amazon AWS API allow diff application to talk each other.client api api microserver microserver  other microserver.
  
  
  - benefits; 
     - cost eficiency, not need investmenet for hardware, scalable with the needs
     - elasticity and flexiblity, give chance to increase or decrese using resource, it wors everywhere
      - reliability, secure data, always have back up ready
      - increased security, no need security cost, everything on cloud is secure against broken or stolen,
      - manageability, u need just internet and laptop to reach everything
      - availablity, extending if needed bandwith, execution and operation continue flow
      - centralization, all data in one location, reachable everywhere
      - auto-update, cloude service provider do verything
      - no maintenence, 
   
   
   
   - disadvantages;
      - internete dependancy, low speed is diffucult to reach
      - downtime, if loud provider down, no reach
      - loss control, if u use cloud, u know that sensitive data is also shairing
      - lack of support, no needed support at all the time
 
 
 
 
 Topics - Cloud Computing Architecture
  - Front-end and Back-end
  - Fe - client part, user, user interface, ie. webbrowsers
  - Be - host manage, virtual machine, data storage, deployment models, traffic control, et. built in security systems.
  - Actor / Role Based Model; cloud consumer, cloud provider, cloud broker, cloud auditor, cloud carries.
  
  
  
 Topics - Cloud Deployment Models
  - Public Cloud, Private Cloud, Community Cloud, Hybrid Cloud
  - Broad network access, self service, measured service, shared resource, elastic.
  - Amazon EC2, Google AppEngine, Windows Azure, IBM Blue Cloud are public clouds
  - private cloud is more secure, prevent data loss, reduce cost some condition.
  - community cloud, lower cost, easy to share and colloborate



Topics - Service Models
  - https://youtu.be/36zducUX16w
  - Software as a servise, on-demand service, pay per use, independent platform, no need to install, avaliable for multiple user, cheap, vendor manage, reach by browser, acceessible form any platform, reach from everywhere, good for colloboration, vendor provide modest tools, allow for multi user, pratable, internet performance important, some restriction, especially END Customers
  - Platform as a services, Develeopers use it
  - Infrastructure as a service, Sys admins use it, like amazon ec2, icloud apple. azure, ggole cloud, 
  
  
  
  
Topics - Cloud Service Models
  - On-premise; everthing depends you
  - Infrastructure as a service, scalable
  - Platform as a service, AWS Elacstic Beanstalk, FGoogle app enginde, microsoft azure, cost time eeffectif and sit for one application devellopper
  - Software as a service, connect and use model over internet, e mail, office, reliable
  - 
  
 
Topics - Deployment Models
  - public cloud; it is opel all, aws, google cloud etc. inside that it could be private cloud in it, 
  - private cloud; only autorized people get in.
  - hybrid cloud; banking system use it, user see a page, banker see another page.developper use diff cloud for beta version and full version that is an example.
  - community cloud, multiple sister companies use all he same cloud with diff specification
